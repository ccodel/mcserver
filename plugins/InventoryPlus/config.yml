# General Info:
#  - Type nothing between the '' when customizing a message to disable it. Leave the '' there.
#  - When customizing a message, don't write 'don't'. Instead, write 'dont'. Avoid the '.
#  - If your config breaks, use a YAML Phaser to check it.
#  - If you have any trouble setting the plugin up/found any bugs, please report them on the InventoryPlus BukkitDev side.
#  - Custom items/modded items ARE supported. Equip the item and type /ivitem to get the ID and durability (if it exists).
